# To-do :
# Add more comments explaining things like wtf suka - priority medium - done
# Whitespace is cool - priority high - done
# Create a makeshift search - priority high
	# > Updateable by : bare getindex
	# > Uses grep to search in the file
	# > Deletes the already existing index before wgetting the new one
	# > index has the creators name in the file
	# > index would be sorted by oldest added
	# > searches by : bare search
	# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
